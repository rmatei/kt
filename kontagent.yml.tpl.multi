    #              interface to this test server, which shows the number of 
    #              different types of messages that have been received in the last
    #              three hours and the parameters associated with the last 10

    #              issues you may encounter.
    #
    #              The test server can be accessed on the Kontagent website by

    #              SERVER. The test server is merely intended as a test tool and
